for i in 1 to 100(say)
 get clusters with minimum loss
-- 1st level --
for each cluster
	if log10(no of nodes in cluster) <= 2: find spanning tree directly

	else
		recurse step1 for this cluster
		

# 
Find spanning tree from a given node
TOPO SORT from that node, find node with max indegree, that node is the representative for that iter
(optional: Run loop k no of times, pick one with max indegree)
